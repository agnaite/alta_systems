			<h3>Case Study</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="col-md-8">
			<p>ALTA SmartBalloons have worked in conjunction with a wide variety of public safety agencies across an assortment of mission profiles.  We have experiences at the local, state, and federal levels in planned and direct response scenarios for a full range of incidents.<br><br>
 
			On October 10, 2015, ALTA became the first low altitude imagery vehicle to monitor a major sporting event as Florida State University hosted the University of Miami in NCAA Division 1 Men's Football.  This marked a milestone in the public safety realm as ALTA captured information no other vehicle could, in ways no one else ever had.<br><br>
			 
			Due to the confidentially needs of our clients, ALTA case studies are available for select review by qualified and credentialed representatives from public safety agencies and other strategic partner organizations.  Contact us for additional infromation or to arrange access to review our case studies.
